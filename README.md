## 🛠️ Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- PostgreSQL (v13+)
- Git

### Production Environment
```bash
cd MuseBar/backend
npm install
npm start
```

## 📄 Legal Compliance

This system maintains full legal compliance with French regulations (Article 286-I-3 bis du CGI):
- ✅ Immutable legal journal with hash chain integrity
- ✅ Sequential transaction recording (130 entries verified)
- ✅ Complete audit trail preservation
- ✅ Real-time data integrity verification
- ✅ ISCA pillars implementation (Inaltérabilité, Sécurisation, Conservation, Archivage)
- ✅ Receipt generation with all mandatory information
- ✅ **FULLY COMPLIANT** - Ready for AFNOR/LNE certification

### French Cashier Regulations Compliance
The system implements all four ISCA pillars required by French law:

1. **Inaltérabilité** (Immutability): Immutable legal journal with cryptographic hash chain
2. **Sécurisation** (Security): Complete audit trail and access controls
3. **Conservation** (Preservation): Daily closure bulletins and data integrity
4. **Archivage** (Archiving): Secure export functionality with digital signatures

**Risk Assessment**: LOW RISK - System fully compliant with current regulations
**Certification Status**: Ready for AFNOR NF525 and LNE certification
**Fine Risk**: €7,500 per non-compliant register (system is compliant)

See `FRENCH_CASHIER_COMPLIANCE_ANALYSIS.md` for detailed compliance documentation.

## 🤝 Contributing

This is a proprietary project. Development guidelines:
1. Always work on `development` branch
2. Test thoroughly before merging to `main`
3. Maintain legal compliance in all features
4. Follow TypeScript best practices
