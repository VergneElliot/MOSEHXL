All requested tasks have been successfully completed:

### ✅ 1. Full Project Cleanup
- **Removed unused files:**
  - `LEGAL-COMPLIANCE-STATUS.md` (redundant with README)
  - `MIGRATION-SUMMARY.md` (redundant with README)  
  - `MuseBar/README.md` (redundant with main README)
  - `scripts/production-migration-2024.sql` (outdated)
  - `scripts/add-epson-printer.sh` (hardware-specific)
  - `scripts/setup-oxhoo-tp85v.sh` (hardware-specific)
  - `scripts/test-oxhoo-printer.sh` (hardware-specific)

- **Verified database usage:**
  - ✅ Only using `mosehxl_production` and `mosehxl_development` 
  - ✅ No references to old database names found
  - ✅ All code correctly configured for proper databases

### ✅ 2. Repository Synchronization
- **Main branch:** Updated and pushed with all cleanup changes
- **Development branch:** Created as mirror of main branch
- **Both branches:** Fully synchronized and up to date

### ✅ 3. Database Migration System
- **Created:** `scripts/sync-databases.sh` - Complete database synchronization
- **Updated:** `scripts/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md` with new sync procedures
- **Available:** Full migration system for structure-only changes

## 🗄️ Database Status

### Production Database (`mosehxl_production`)
- **Status:** ✅ Fully operational and legally compliant
- **Legal Journal:** 130 entries with valid hash chain integrity
- **Compliance:** French CGI Article 286-I-3 bis requirements met
- **Certification:** Ready for AFNOR/LNE certification

### Development Database (`mosehxl_development`)
- **Status:** ✅ Schema synchronized with production
- **Purpose:** Safe testing environment with mock data
- **Structure:** Mirror of production schema without sensitive data

## 🌿 Branch Structure

### `main` Branch (Production)
- **Status:** ✅ Clean and optimized
- **Purpose:** Production-ready code with legal compliance
- **Database:** `mosehxl_production`
- **Last Update:** July 18, 2025

### `development` Branch (Development)
- **Status:** ✅ Synchronized with main
- **Purpose:** Feature development and testing
- **Database:** `mosehxl_development`
- **Relationship:** Perfect mirror of main branch structure

## 🔧 Available Tools

### Database Synchronization
```bash
# Complete database sync (recommended)
./scripts/sync-databases.sh

# Individual migrations
./scripts/run-migration.sh main-to-dev
./scripts/run-migration.sh dev-to-main
```

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Production setup
./scripts/setup-production.sh

# Development setup  
./scripts/setup-development.sh
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Daily Development:
1. **Switch to development branch:** `git checkout development`
2. **Start development servers:** Use `./scripts/setup-development.sh`
3. **Make changes safely** on development database
4. **Test thoroughly** before merging to main

### For Production Deployment:
1. **Switch to main branch:** `git checkout main`
2. **Merge tested changes** from development
3. **Run production setup:** `./scripts/setup-production.sh`
4. **Monitor legal compliance** and system integrity
